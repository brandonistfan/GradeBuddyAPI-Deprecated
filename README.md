# GradeBuddy API (Deprecated)

**OVERVIEW**:  
(Deprecated version of GradeBuddy. This version is the API for the hackathon project, but it has since been replaced by NextJS and a new implementation -> gradebuddy.app)

This repository contains the API that interacts with Firebase and OpenAI LLM, powering the GradeBuddy application. GradeBuddy is an educational assessment tool that instantly grades student responses (including free-response and essays), helping faculty save time and provide timely feedback to students.
